# Clustering Assignment using PyCaret

This repository explores the application of various clustering algorithms to a sales-transaction dataset using PyCaret. The objective is to assess the efficacy of these techniques across different preprocessing methods and evaluation metrics.

## Dataset Overview

The data, sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/396/sales+transactions+dataset+weekly), consists of weekly purchase quantities for over 800 products spanning 52 weeks. To improve the clarity and accuracy of analysis, normalized values have been manually omitted.

## Clustering Techniques Employed

We implement and evaluate the following clustering algorithms:
- **KMeans**: Popular for its simplicity and efficiency in clustering large datasets.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: A hierarchical clustering method using a bottom-up approach.
- **Birch**: Designed for very large datasets, utilizing a tree structure for clustering.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the clustering algorithms is measured using:
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures the consistency within clusters.
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Evaluates clusters based on their density and separation.
- **Davies-Bouldin Index**: The lower the index, the better the separation between clusters.

## Pre-Processing Techniques

To prepare the data for clustering, we applied the following methods:
- **Normalization**: Scales the data to a uniform range.
- **Transformation**: Converts data to approximate normality.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining most variance.
- **Combined Techniques**: We experimented with combinations like Normalization + Transformation and Normalization + Transformation + PCA to investigate their impact on clustering performance.

## Graphs and Visualizations

We provide a series of graphs to visually assess the effectiveness of each clustering method:
1. **Distribution Plots**: Visualizing cluster distribution can help identify the cohesiveness of data points within each cluster.
   - **KMeans**: ![KMeans Distribution](images/Distribution/KMeans.png)
   - **Agglomerative**: ![Agglomerative Distribution](images/Distribution/Agglomerative.png)
   - **Birch**: ![Birch Distribution](images/Distribution/Birch.png)

2. **Silhouette Scores**: These graphs highlight the silhouette score for each clustering method, indicative of how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.
   - **KMeans**: ![KMeans Silhouette](images/Silhouette/KMeans.png)
   - **Birch**: ![Birch Silhouette](images/Silhouette/Birch.png)

3. **TSNE Plots**: t-SNE reduces dimensionality for visualization of the dataset and provides insights into the data clustering structure.
   - **KMeans**: ![KMeans TSNE](images/TSNE/KMeans.png)
   - **Agglomerative**: ![Agglomerative TSNE](images/TSNE/Agglomerative.png)
   - **Birch**: ![Birch TSNE](images/TSNE/Birch.png)

## Results Summary

The results of our clustering experiments are compiled in a detailed table, showcasing the performance across all applied techniques.

## Conclusion

Based on our evaluations, **KMeans Clustering** stands out as the most effective algorithm for this dataset, especially notable for achieving the highest Silhouette score without the need for preprocessing enhancements.
